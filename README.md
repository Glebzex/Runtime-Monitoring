Runtime Monitoring
===

Runtime Monitoring is an easy way for you to monitor the state of your C# classes and objects during runtime. Just add the 'Monitor' attribute to a field, property, event, [method*](## "Not yet implemented") or [class*](## "Not yet implemented") and get its value or state displayed automatically in a customizable and extendable UI.

## Getting Started

```c#
// Place the MonitorAttribute on any field, property or event.
[Monitor]
private int healthPoints;

[Monitor]
public int HealthPoints { get; private set; }

[Monitor]
public event Action OnHealthChanged;

[Monitor]
public static string playerName;

[Monitor]
protected static bool IsPlayerAlive { get; set; }

[Monitor]
internal static event Action<int> OnScoreChanged;

// Determine if and in what quantity the state will be evaluated.
[MonitorField(Update = UpdateOptions.FrameUpdate)]
private float speed; 

// Reduce update overhead by providing an update event.
[MonitorProperty(UpdateEvent = nameof(OnPlayerSpawn))]
public bool LastSpawnPosition { get; set; }

[MonitorEvent]
public static event Action<Vector3> OnPlayerSpawn;

// Monitored events display their signature, subscriber count and invokation count.
// These options can be toggled using the MonitorEventAttribute. 
[MonitorEvent(ShowSignature = false, ShowSubscriber = true)]
public event OnGameStart;

// Use processor methods to customize how the value is displayed.
[Monitor]
[ValueProcessor(nameof(IsAliveProcessor))]
public bool IsAlive { get; private set; }

private string IsAliveProcessor(bool value) => value? "Alive" : "Dead";
```

## Import

Import this asset into your project as a .unitypackage available at [Runtime-Monitoring/releases](https://github.com/JohnBaracuda/Runtime-Monitoring/releases) or clone this repository and use it directly. 

Depending on your needs you may select or deselect individual modules when importing. ```Monitoring```, ```Monitoring Editor``` & ```Threading``` are essensial modules for this asset. ```Monitoring Example``` contains an optional example scene and [Monitoring UI](#ui-controller) contains UI / Display preset that should work out of the box with different Unity UI Systems.

 Assembly                    | Path                             | Editor           | Core

&nbsp;
## Setup
Everything should work out of the box after a successful import. If however you want to validate that everything is set up correctly or you want to change for example the active [Monitoring UI Controller](#ui-controller), the following steps will guide you through that process.

+ Open the settings by navigating to (menu: Tools > Monitoring > Settings).
+ Ensure that both ```Enable Monitoring``` and ```Open Display On Load``` are set to ```true```.
+ Use the ```Monitoring UI Controller``` field in the UI Controller foldout to set the active UI Controller. The inspector of the set UI Controller object will be inlined and can be edited from the settings window.

## Monitoring Objects

When monitoring non static member of a class, instances of those classes must be registered when they are created and unregistered when they are destoryed. This process can be automated or simplified, by inheriting from one of the following base types. 
+ ```MonitoredBehaviour```: an automatically monitored ```MonoBehaviour```
+ ```MonitoredSingleton<T>```: an automatically monitored ```MonoBehaviour``` singleton.
+ ```MonitoredScriptableObject```: an automatically monitored ```ScriptableObject```.
+ ```MonitoredObject```: an automatically monitored ```System.Object```. that implements the ```IDisposable``` interface. Please make sure to call ```Disposable``` on those objects when you no longer need them. 


```c#
public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Monitor]
    private int healthPoints;

    private void Awake()
    {
        MonitoringUnitManager.RegisterTarget(this);
        // Or use the extension method:
        this.RegisterMonitor();
    }

    private void OnDestroy()
    {
        MonitoringUnitManager.UnregisterTarget(this);
        // Or use the extension method:
        this.UnregisterMonitor();
    }
}

// Simplified by inheriting from MonitoredBehaviour.
public class Player : MonitoredBehaviour
{
    [Monitor]
    private int healthPoints;
}
```

&nbsp;
## Value Processor

You can add the ValueProcessorAttribute to a monitored field or porperty to gain more controll of its string representation. Use the attibute to pass the name of a method that will be used to parse the current value to a string.

The value processor method must accept a value of the monitored members type, can be both static and non static (when monitoring a non non static member) and must return a string.

```c#
[ValueProcessor(nameof(IsAliveProcessor))]
[Monitor] 
private bool isAlive;

private string IsAliveProcessor(bool isAliveValue)
{
    return isAliveValue ? "Player is Alive" : "Player is Dead!";
}
```
```c#
[ValueProcessor(nameof(IListProcessor))] 
[Monitor] private IList<string> names = new string[] {"Gordon", "Alyx", "Barney"};

private string IListProcessor(IList<string> elements)
{
    var str = string.Empty;
    foreach (var name in elements)
    {
        str += name;
        str += "\n";
    }
    return str;
}
```

Static processor methods can have certain overloads for objects that impliment generic collection interfaces, which allow you to process the value of individual elements of the collection instead of the whole collection all at once. 

```c#
//IList<T> ValueProcessor
[ValueProcessor(nameof(IListProcessor))] 
[Monitor] private IList<string> names = new string[] {"Gordon", "Alyx", "Barney"};

private static string IListProcessor(string element)
{
    return $"The name is {element}";
}


[ValueProcessor(nameof(IListProcessorWithIndex))] 
[Monitor] private IList<string> Names => names;

private static string IListProcessorWithIndex(string element, int index)
{
    return $"The name at index {index} is {element}";
}
```
```c#
//IDictionary<TKey, TValue> ValueProcessor
[ValueProcessor(nameof(IDictionaryProcessor))]
[Monitor] private IDictionary<string, bool> isAliveDictionary = new Dictionary<string, bool>
{
    {"Bondrewd", true}, 
    {"Lyza", false}
};

private static string IDictionaryProcessor(string name, bool isAlive)
{
    return $"{name} is {(isAlive ? "alive" : "dead")}";
}
```
```c#
//IEnumerable<T> ValueProcessor
[ValueProcessor(nameof(IEnumerableValueProcessor))]
[Monitor] 
private IEnumerable<int> randomNumbers = new List<int>
{
    1, 43, 14, 65, 23, 174, 16, 2, 786, 4, 89
};

private static string IEnumerableValueProcessor(int number)
{
    return $"{number} is {((number & 1) == 0? "Even" : "Odd")}";
}
```

&nbsp;
## Update Loop

Monitord member are evaluated in an update loop. You can provide an event that will tell monitoring that a value has changed to remove it from the update loop. 


```c#
public enum UpdateOptions
{
    Auto = 0,
    DontUpdate = 1,
    FrameUpdate = 2,
    TickUpdate = 4,
}
```

+ ```UpdateOtions.Auto```: If an update event is set, the state of the members  will only be evaluated when the event is invoked. Otherwise Tick is the preferred update interval. 

+ ```UpdateOtions.DontUpdate```: The members will not be evaluated except once on load. Use this option for constant values.

+ ```UpdateOtions.FrameUpdate```: The member will be evaluated on every LateUpdate.

+ ```UpdateOtions.TickUpdate```: The member will be evaluated on every Tick. Tick is a custom update cycle that is roughly called 30 times per second.


&nbsp;

## Update Event

When monitoring a field or a property (Value units) you can provide an 'OnValueChanged' event that will tell the monitored unit that the state of the member has changed.

This event can either be an ```Action``` or an ```Action<T>```, with T being the type of the monitored field or property. Note that once a valid update event was provided the unit will not be evaluated during an update cycle anymore, unless  ```UpdateOptions``` are explicitly set to ```UpdateOptions.Auto``` or ```UpdateOptions.FrameUpdate```. 

Passing an event will slightly reduce performance overhead for values or member that you know will update rarely. It is however not required.

```c#
private int healthPoints;
public event Action<int> OnHealthChanged;

[Monitor(UpdateEvent = nameof(OnHealthChanged))]
public int HealthPoints 
{
    get => healthPoints;
    private set
    {
        healthPoints = value;
        OnHealthChanged?.Invoke(healthPoints);
    }
}
```

```c#
[Monitor(UpdateEvent = nameof(OnGameStateChanged))]
private bool isGamePaused;

public event Action OnGameStateChanged;

public void PauseGame()
{
    isGamePaused = true;
    OnGameStateChanged?.Invoke();
}

public void ContinueGame()
{
    isGamePaused = false;
    OnGameStateChanged?.Invoke();
}
```



&nbsp;
## Runtime

The true purpose of this tool is to provide an easy way to debug and monitor build games. Both Mono & IL2CPP runtimes are supported. Mono runtime works without any limitations.

### IL2CPP

Monitoring is making extensive use of dynamic type & method creation during its initialization process. This means that the IL2CPP runtime has a hard time because it requires AOT compilation (Ahead of time compilation)

In order to use IL2CPP as a runtime some features are disabled or reduced and some types must be generated during a build process, that can then be used by the IL2CPP runtime as templates. You can configure the IL2CPP AOT type generation from the monitoring settings.


&nbsp;
## UI Controller

The monitoring system does not controll any UI elements. It is almost compleatly separated from UI but provides an easy way to either chose one of the prefabricated UI modules or to create a custom UI Solution based on individual preferences. 

Because Unity has multiple UI systems every prefabricated UI Module is based on one of them. At the moment only UI Toolkit is implimented but Unity UI and event GUI are planned as upcoming features. Use the ```MonitoringDisplay``` API to control the current Monitoring UI, independent of its implementation.

```c#
using Baracuda.Monitoring.API;

// Show the monitoring UI overlay.
MonitoringDisplay.Show();

// Hide the monitoring UI overlay.
MonitoringDisplay.Hide();

// Toggle the visibility of the active monitoring display.
// This method returns a bool indicating the new visibility state.
MonitoringDisplay.ToggleDisplay();

// Returns true if the there is an active monitoring display that is also visible.
MonitoringDisplay.IsVisible();
```


### UI Toolkit

Currently the only implimented UI Solution. UI Toolkit is only available when using Unity 2020.1 or newer. 

### Unity UI

Unity UI is not yet implimented. 


&nbsp;
## Custom UI Controller

You can create a custom UI controller by follwing the steps below. A more detailed guide how to setup a custom UI controller is coming.

+ Create a new class and inherit from ```MonitoringDisplayController```.
+ Impliment the abstract mehtods and custom UI logic.
+ Add the script to a new GameObject and create a prefab of it.
+ Make sure to delete the GameObject from your scene.
+ Open the settings by navigating to (menu: Tools > Monitoring > Settings).
+ Set your prefab as the active controller in the ```Moniotoring UI Controller``` field.

&nbsp;
## Assemblies and Modules

Runtime Monitoring is separated into multiple assemblies / modules. Some of those modules are essential while others are not.
